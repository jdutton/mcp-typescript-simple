# TODO - Issue #68: Add Pre-commit Hook and Document SDLC Automation

## Current Status
**Branch**: `feature/enhance-test-robustness-and-sdlc-tooling`
**Issue**: #68
**Status**: READY FOR VALIDATION

## Summary

This PR adds infrastructure improvements to the SDLC automation tooling:

1. **Pre-commit Hook** - Husky-based pre-commit hook that enforces validation before commits
2. **Documentation** - Comprehensive documentation of SDLC automation tools
3. **Extraction Strategy** - Documented plan for extracting SDLC tools as `@agentic-workflow` OSS package

## Completed Work ✅

### 1. Pre-commit Hook (NEW)
- ✅ Installed Husky (`npm install husky`)
- ✅ Created `.husky/pre-commit` that runs `npm run pre-commit`
- ✅ Added `prepare` script to package.json to initialize Husky
- ✅ Enforces validation state check before commits
- ✅ Compares git tree hash to ensure validation is current
- **Result**: Deterministic commit gating (no more "remembering" to validate!)

### 2. Documentation
- ✅ `docs/agentic-workflow-extraction.md` - Full extraction strategy for OSS
- ✅ `docs/pre-commit-hook.md` - Pre-commit hook documentation
- ✅ Updated `CLAUDE.md` with:
  - Comprehensive SDLC Automation Tooling section
  - Tool overviews and usage examples
  - Integration examples and references

## What Changed

### Files Added
- `.husky/pre-commit` - Pre-commit hook script
- `docs/agentic-workflow-extraction.md` - OSS extraction plan
- `docs/pre-commit-hook.md` - Hook documentation

### Files Modified
- `package.json` - Added Husky dependency and prepare script
- `package-lock.json` - Updated dependencies
- `CLAUDE.md` - Added SDLC Automation Tooling section
- `TODO.md` - This file (updated to reflect infrastructure-only PR)

## Key Insights

### Pre-commit Hook Design Philosophy
**Problem**: AI agents must "remember" to validate → probabilistic, error-prone
**Solution**: Pre-commit hook enforces validation → deterministic, reliable

**How it works**:
1. `.husky/pre-commit` → `npm run pre-commit` → `tools/pre-commit-check.ts`
2. Compares current git tree hash to `.validation-state.yaml` tree hash
3. If hashes match → fast checks only (typecheck + lint)
4. If hashes differ → requires full validation
5. If validation failed → blocks commit with clear message

**Benefits**:
- No more "did I run validation?" uncertainty
- Fast path when code unchanged (2-3 seconds)
- Works for Claude Code AND humans
- Deterministic enforcement

### SDLC Automation Tooling Value

Based on chief-arch agent research, our tooling is **unique**:

**Competitive Advantages**:
| Feature | Our Tooling | Nx/Turborepo | Lefthook/Husky | GitHub CLI |
|---------|-------------|--------------|----------------|------------|
| Git tree hash caching | ✅ | ❌ Content hash | ❌ | ❌ |
| Agent-first design | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Safety-first (no auto-merge) | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ Partial |
| Integrated workflow | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

**Market Opportunity**: Extract as `@agentic-workflow` OSS tool
- Target users: Claude Code, Cursor, Aider, Continue
- Estimated timeline: 7-10 weeks to production OSS
- See full plan: `docs/agentic-workflow-extraction.md`

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Run `npm run validate` to ensure all tests pass
2. ✅ Commit changes with descriptive message
3. ✅ Push to GitHub
4. ⏳ Monitor PR checks
5. ⏳ Create issue #69 for Vitest migration (follow-up PR)

## Follow-up Work (Issue #69)

The Vitest migration work has been **stashed** (not lost!) and will be completed in a separate PR:

```bash
# Stashed work includes:
# - Vitest configuration files
# - Updated package.json with Vitest dependencies
# - Jest → Vitest API conversions (partial)
# - 181/294 tests passing (113 remaining to fix)
```

**To resume Vitest work:**
```bash
# Create new branch for issue #69
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/complete-vitest-migration

# Apply stashed changes
git stash list  # Find the stash: "vitest-migration-for-issue-69"
git stash apply stash@{0}  # or specific stash number

# Continue fixing tests
npm run test:unit
```

## Testing the Pre-commit Hook

```bash
# Test 1: Make a change and try to commit (should require validation)
echo "// test" >> src/index.ts
git add src/index.ts
git commit -m "test"
# → Should prompt: "Run npm run validate first"

# Test 2: Run validation and commit (should succeed)
npm run validate
git commit -m "test"
# → Should succeed with fast checks only

# Test 3: Commit without code changes (should be fast)
echo "# test" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "docs: update README"
# → Should succeed with fast checks only (2-3 seconds)
```
