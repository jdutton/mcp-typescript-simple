/**
 * Stop a child process and its entire process group
 * Uses negative PID to kill process group, ensuring all children are terminated
 *
 * Implementation:
 * - Graceful shutdown: SIGTERM to process group (-PID)
 * - Force kill after 1s: SIGKILL to process group
 * - Ultimate timeout: Resolves after 2s regardless
 *
 * Used by:
 * - Test cleanup (afterAll hooks)
 * - Validation runner (signal handlers, fail-fast)
 * - System test utilities
 *
 * @param childProcess - The child process to stop
 * @param processName - Optional name for logging (e.g., "MCP Inspector", "Test Server")
 * @returns Promise that resolves when process is stopped
